## Learnings 📖



## How can this project be improved? 🛠️

-**Make the web app responsive for smaller screens**: This web app was created for desktops, but adjusting it for cell phones would be a good idea & would expand the number of potential users
-**Make pop up text notifications**: Currently, users can only see texts when they are on a text thread with the a specific user. It would be beneficial to create pop-up notifications so users get alerted of texts when they are texting others or simply idle.
-**Allow users to upload their own profile picture**: Currently, profile pictures are randomized using an avatar placeholder API available here: <https://avatar-placeholder.iran.liara.run/>
-**Allow users to add a short bio/status**: This would appear under their name. This would be a cool feature to add which allow users to customize their profile & make the web app more unique.
-**Allow for pictures & videos to be sent**: Currently, only texts can be sent through the web app.
